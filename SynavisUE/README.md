# SynavisUE
Unreal Engine Integration for WebRTC Synthetic Data Training

- Generation of synthetic data
- Built-in Data Camera for PixelStreaming
- Built-in tracking capabilities for UE scenes

## Introduction

Our framework rests on the Synavis framework to accompany this project. While it can be used separately, the two components are developed and tested together, and we cannot guarantee working of the SynavisDrone when it is connected to other clients aside from Synavis.

Synavis enables the coupling of simulation and ML tools to the Unreal Engine by leveraging PixelStreaming as data source.
