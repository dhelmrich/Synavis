# What if I have problems?

Please open an issue on GitHub describing the problem you are facing. Currently there are no other support channels readily available, but for more specific and/or urgent issues, you can also contact me via any means available on my [personal website](https://www.dirkbaker.eu).

# How can I contribute?

Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your proposed changes. As this software stack is very experimental still, please always make a case for your merge requests by detailing the problem you are solving or the feature you are adding. If you change anything about the Unreal Engine implementation, always provide screenshots or videos demonstrating the changes.
